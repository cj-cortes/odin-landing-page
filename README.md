Project: Landing Page

In this project, I learned to build a landing page with a header, placeholder for images, a call-to-action button, and a footer. This allowed me to practice the concepts I learned from the readings by writing HTML and CSS--especially focusing on the use of Flexbox in the stylesheet.
